# CMPG-323-Project-5-24361879

Welcome to project 5. Monitoring and Reporting in power Bi. Version control like we did in project 4 is not possible with power bi and github.
I'll need to upload each iteration of the pbix file manually and then update my github readme file after each commit. 

I have made the first commit and it contains a pbix file. In the file there are two pages, Device Registration and Device Monitoring. Device Monitoring contains the following:

I count the number of registered devices by their sub category ID and Zone ID in the two donut charts.
In the stacked column chart I compare the device status between inactive and active.
THese reports were requested in the rubric and indicate quantity of devices by device name.

On the Device Registration page I have the following:

Here I count sub category ID be device name in the stacked bar chart. And we have two time oriented reports. In the stacked column chart we count registered devices by their zone ID's and determine in which year they were installed/registered. The report at the top is fun to look at, here I used a timeline slicer, combined with a line chart. The timeline slicer works better when there are more datapoints but you can see the just of it here. It represents months, quarters and years...but can go down as far as days. It compares those three time dimensions to the line chart underneath which counts the number of registered device ID's by year.
